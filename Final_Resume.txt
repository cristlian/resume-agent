WORK EXPERIENCE

SOFTWARE ENGINEERING INTERN
Coach Cube AI | London, UK | Jul 2024 - Aug 2024

- Architected and delivered a modular, model-agnostic perception service MVP in 8 weeks, designing clean REST APIs to support real-time AI inference.
- Productionised machine learning workflows by containerising services (Docker) and implementing a CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions) with automated unit and integration testing (PyTest) to ensure regression-safe deployments.
- Developed Python-based data ingestion and validation pipelines to normalize heterogeneous annotation formats, enforcing strict schema consistency across training datasets.
- Instrumented system observability using structured logging and telemetry dashboards to monitor throughput, latency, and error rates, enabling rapid diagnosis of production incidents.
- Conducted trade-off analysis for model selection (YOLO backbone vs. custom heads), balancing accuracy against compute cost and frame-rate constraints for investor demonstrations.
- Integrated GenAI coding assistants into the development lifecycle to accelerate boilerplate generation, unit test scaffolding, and technical documentation.

RESEARCH EXPERIENCE

RESEARCH ASSISTANT (ROBOTICS PERCEPTION)
UCL Computer Science Dept. | London, UK | Oct 2023 - Oct 2024

- Engineered a benchmarking pipeline to evaluate AI rendering approaches (Gaussian Splatting vs. SfM) for robotics simulation, handling large-scale unstructured video data.
- Implemented automated data loaders and format adapters in Python to manage heterogeneous datasets, optimizing I/O performance for batch processing.
- Defined and implemented quantitative metrics (IoU, reprojection error) to assess system fidelity, identifying input data quality as the critical bottleneck for downstream perception performance.
- Ensured research reproducibility through rigorous version control, pinned dependency environments, and deterministic seeding of experiments.

RESEARCH ASSISTANT (DATA SYSTEMS)
Hybrid Body Lab, Cornell University | Ithaca, NY, USA | Jun 2024 - Sep 2024

- Developed Python tooling for hardware data capture and calibration, establishing structured logging protocols to support downstream ML analysis.
- Standardised synchronization logic and sanity checks to ensure data integrity across hardware-software interfaces.

PROJECT EXPERIENCE

OBJECT-CENTRIC SLAM PIPELINE
UCL EEE Department | Sep 2023 - Jun 2024
- Built a Python-based SLAM system that utilizes detected objects as landmarks to construct 3D scene graphs from monocular video.
- Implemented a modular pipeline consisting of detection, data association, and pose updates using OpenCV and NumPy, optimizing for robustness in low-texture environments.
- Developed diagnostic tools for intrinsic/extrinsic calibration and reprojection error analysis to debug mapping failures and improve system stability.

ENHANCED SOFT ACTOR-CRITIC (SAC) AGENT
Imperial College London | Oct 2024 - Present
- Implemented a Soft Actor-Critic reinforcement learning agent in PyTorch, incorporating automatic entropy tuning for stable continuous control.
- Designed training diagnostics (loss-vs-torque plots, phase portraits) to detect instability and validate policy safety prior to deployment.
- Engineered a "safety cage" PID controller to guard against noise and latency, ensuring robust operation under simulated hardware constraints.
