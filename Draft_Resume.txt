EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The following resume is tailored for the AI Engineer role at Unity Advisory. It emphasizes "production-grade" engineering over pure academic research, aligning with the firm's focus on building robust internal systems.

1. **Production Engineering Focus**: The "Coach Cube AI" experience is restructured to highlight API design, Docker containerization, CI/CD pipelines, and observability (telemetry/dashboards), directly addressing the requirement to "build APIs, services, and pipelines supporting AI use cases."
2. **Internal Tools & GenAI**: The "Smart Task Tracker" project is prioritized to demonstrate full-stack capability (React/Node) and familiarity with vector search/embeddings, addressing the "Nice to Have" regarding search/retrieval systems and internal tool building.
3. **Data & Workflow Optimization**: Specific achievements regarding data schema standardization and automated ingestion pipelines were selected to match the requirement for handling "structured and unstructured data" and improving productivity workflows.
4. **Tech Stack Alignment**: Skills are grouped to highlight Python, API development, Cloud (AWS/Azure), and GenAI orchestration, which are central to the job description.

WORK EXPERIENCE

SOFTWARE ENGINEERING INTERN
Coach Cube AI | London, UK | Jul 2025 - Aug 2025

- Designed and built a modular, model-agnostic perception service, delivering a production-ready MVP in 8 weeks.
- Developed and deployed clean REST APIs and data ingestion pipelines to support real-time AI use cases.
- Productionised machine learning infrastructure by wrapping services in Docker containers and establishing CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions) with automated unit/integration testing, reducing deployment rollbacks by 25%.
- Instrumented comprehensive system observability, implementing structured logging and telemetry to track latency, throughput, and error rates.
- Built internal data-quality tools and dashboards (drift flags, class distribution) to monitor system health and data integrity, reducing mean incident-triage time by 12%.
- Standardised data annotation schemas and validation logic, creating automated cleaning scripts that reduced invalid data entry by 20%.
- Integrated GenAI coding assistants (Gemini, Claude) into the engineering workflow for scaffolding, testing, and documentation, increasing development velocity by approximately 15%.

RESEARCH ASSISTANT (DATA & SYSTEMS)
Hybrid Body Lab, Cornell University | Ithaca, NY, USA | Jun 2024 - Sep 2024

- Developed Python-based tooling for data capture, calibration, and structured logging to support downstream analysis.
- Standardised synchronization protocols and sanity checks for hardware-software interfaces, ensuring data reliability for research workflows.

PROJECT EXPERIENCE

SMART TASK TRACKER & GENAI WORKFLOW
Imperial College London | Oct 2025 - Nov 2025
- Built a productivity-focused Single Page Application (SPA) using React 18, TypeScript, and Vite to streamline task management.
- Designed the architecture for a Node.js and PostgreSQL backend, incorporating vector stores and embeddings to enable future RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) features for personalized recommendations.
- Leveraged LLMs for co-designing state models and UX flows, demonstrating practical application of AI in software development lifecycles.

ML RENDERING & DATA EVALUATION PIPELINE
UCL Computer Science Dept | Oct 2023 - Oct 2024
- Engineered a Python-based evaluation pipeline to benchmark AI rendering approaches (Gaussian Splatting vs. Traditional) for robotics simulation.
- Implemented automated data loaders and format adapters to handle large, heterogeneous unstructured datasets.
- Developed rigorous metrics (IoU, reprojection error) to quantify system fidelity, identifying input data quality as the primary bottleneck for performance.

REAL-TIME 3D PERCEPTION SYSTEM
Coach Cube AI (Internship Project) | Jul 2025 - Aug 2025
- Implemented a 2D detection and 3D triangulation pipeline using PyTorch, ONNX, and OpenCV.
- Optimized system performance to balance accuracy, frame rate, and compute costs for real-time demonstration.
